# goal here: make api that takes blueprint pdf as input, and returns the ocr output text as output.
# this should check for the files we want (has M and P in it, could do all to ensure we arent wrong)
# maybe we check with mistral to ensure the extract text makes sense, if not have it improve the text in case ocr missed something.
